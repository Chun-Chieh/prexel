2017-06-08 Meeting Notes

Priority 1)

We needed to determine some code that would be suitable for adding Prexel notation to that people could review and perhaps take a
quiz on.

Ideas:
1.) Java Tutorials
2.) Gang of Four - Java source code (e.g., Abstract Factory)

Priority 2)

Review entry syntax for how a user might use Prexel. Needs to quick to type, but with the option of expanding to a pretty-printed
version.


Tool Description)

The tool would probably be some sort of plugin that is used inside of an IDE. As the user types they could add prexel annotations,
that with the push a button would expand to into pretty-printed UML. The tool would also need to generate XML ( or maybe xmi ) for
each of the fragments. They fragments would htne be combined into one XML document that could be used with a third-party UML design 
tool

- Should we generate XML or something else?
- Seems like this might be two parts. The IDE itegration, the handles the pretty-printing and syntax highlighting and the processing
of the UML fragments. Perhaps pretty-printing should be separate so the processing of the fragments is not contigent on 
the pretty-printing features
