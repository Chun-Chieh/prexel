Starting point:

<some code>

Programmer's thought: I need a class Customer with attribute name and method get_balance

Result of programmer input (We'll call this "quick input" or something):

<some code>
'''
|Customer
|name
|get_balance()
'''

Programmer hits PREXEL button (hopefully....otherwise an equivalent). The result is that
a Customer class with attribute name and method get_balance is created if it does not
already exist, and the source is pretty-printed as in the paper (or much nicer).


<some code>
'''
 _____________
|__Customer___|
|    name     |
|get_balance()|
 -------------
'''

PREXEL works with pretty-printed UML as well as quick input.
Other examples of quick input:

Airplane<>-wing-->Wing

Person
^
Employee

If the developer places more than one of these in a single quote section, they are combined into a single class
figure.

We can also move on to other UML diagrams after this. Maybe.
