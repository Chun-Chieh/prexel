# Prexel

# Instruction

Currently there is a test suite available to test the code. This can be found at:

    prexel/plugin/tests/

Running the test can be done from the command line, with the following command:

    python3 -m unittest prexel/plugin/tests/encoders/test_pretty_print_encoder.py
    python3 -m unittest prexel/plugin/tests/encoders/test_source_code_encoder.py 
    python3 -m unittest prexel/plugin/tests/parser/test_lexer.py
    python3 -m unittest prexel/plugin/tests/test_regex.py

## Design

There four main pieces of the project.

1) Plugin Command Code - This code is responsible for...

2) Parser - 

3) XML - 

4) Encoders - These are responsible for taking the data from XMIAdaptor and 
and turning it into pretty-printed and source code versions

## Progress

Currently all progress has been made on part 2 and 3 of the project as they 
represent the most complex part.
