# 2017-06-15 Meeting Notes

## Discussed

* incremental - everything should relate to something that already exists. Diagram should accumlate. 
* When you hit the button, how much is shown, what is most useful for a developer
* Toggle option for how much is shown
* How much is speculative? How much is it a product?
* Proof of concept
* If the developer has this, does it improve what they doing. Study on comprehension of with embedded UML.

## To Discuss

How should we denote abstract classes and interfaces

E: **What is tbd is how much--if at all--we expect to combine parts within the code. Maybe the developer has the option to show "all classes that relate directly to class X" or "relate 1-2 links away .."** Future work. Can we keep an official backlog and add ideas like this of ours?

Also, I've reviewed both the Java tutorial and the GoF book and I don't know if either will be a good place to draw some common code samples from. The Java tutorials OO section is too brief and all the original code in the GoF book is in C++ and Smalltalk.  Any reason why we can't develop our own classes for the experiment? 


E: **Perhaps to begin with. But the paper would be much better if it dealt with a published design, preferably something that has already been referred to. It dramatically increases chances for acceptance. If we were to find one, we could start with it, otherwise use our own to get started while we search.**



## TODOs
* Look up UML papers, contemporary. What examples are they using. ICSC, papers.
* Look GoF again, python versions.
* Give some thought to how this will actually work.
EclipseJ, PyCharm ( plugin ), Sublime Text ( Python ).
* Update examples with abstract class and dependency. 
* Dependency ( return, param, local ). - what should this code generate? generate code that has all three.
* Send example of docstring conventions
* Find paper using the following
  * ACM: http://dl.acm.org/       
  * IEEE: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp
  * To obtain pdf's, be on the VPN: http://www.bu.edu/tech/services/cccs/remote/vpn/
  * When you reload the ACM or IEEE site after getting on, you should see Boston University mentioned. (ithelp@bu.edu if you get stuck)
